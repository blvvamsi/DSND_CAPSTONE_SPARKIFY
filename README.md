# DSND_CAPSTONE_SPARKIFY
Sparkify project done as part of the Capstone requirement for Udacity Data Scientist NanoDegree

The motivation of this project is to make a machine learning model which predicts customer churn for an imaginary music streaming application called Sparkify.

The original dataset is of 12gb but because of computational restraints , we have chosen to work on a subset of the data(128mb)

This project contains Exploratory data analysis(EDA) of the given dataset ,Feature engineering(Developing new features which help us in predicting churn better), ML modeling , model tuning.

The Packages required for this project are 

Spark , Numpy , Pandas , Seaborn(for visualizations) , Matplotlib(for plotting)

Sparkify.ipynb contains the complete code for this project with detailed description of the steps followed.

Predicting churn is not an easy task and recent advancements in the deep learning field show some interesting new algorithms which outperform machine learning algorithms in terms of predictions. Within the given computational restraints , our model achieves a good f1 score. Feature engineering is one topic where certain improvements can be made.


NOTE: The model tuning part of the project takes nearly 2 hrs to run. I suggest you skip this part and can view the results in my blog post at https://medium.com/@blvvamsi/customer-churn-prediction-using-machine-learning-and-spark-c1fa58770e9e

As always , feel free to comment on any improvements that can be made
